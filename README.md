# Car_Data_Analysis_In_Shiny_App
This is the first proper shiny app that I have ever made by analyzing data obtained from Kaggle.com which goes by the name of "Car Features and MSRP". As one of the my capstone project fulfillment from Algoritma Data Science School, I was assigned to make an interactive application which display useful information with minimum of 2 kinds of input to control the charts, create an interactive charts which display information specifically when we hover the mouse on top of it, and a minimum of 3 tab menu. I was inpired to analyze this data as I have a bit of better understanding in the automotive world. 

Although the criteria was challenging enough for beginner such as myself, I went ahead and explore many things which I can possibly do by converting my imagination and C++ logic knowledge from way back when I was working on my bachelor degree, into R language as the based programming for shiny app. It is a really fun project and a backbreaking one at the same time, but with a rewarding result where I, as a beginner, can proudly publish in here. I hope this project can also inspire many others to go to an even further features exploration to be added into their shiny app project.
